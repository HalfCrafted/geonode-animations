Analyze all files in the folder, focusing on the .py scripts, which are working examples of geometry node tree generators in Blender 4.4 that create animations when run. Study how these scripts are constructed, identify what makes them correct, and avoid the common mistakes listed in error-prevention.md. Once you understand the workflow for building node trees, notify me so we can begin creating new geometry node animation scripts. You may create additional Python files both for running the tree creation process and for diagnostics to troubleshoot errors or provide extra context. Use any necessary commands to complete the task, and refer to online resources or the Blender 4.4 documentation if needed, though the provided scripts should offer ample guidance. When ready to test, launch Blender without the UI from the command line using run_blender.bat and run your new Python scripts directly; this will allow you to view print() output for debugging and make adjustments before the script is finalized for analysis of the generated visual effect.
